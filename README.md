# Nick Cave lyric search

Inspired by [shaynak/taylor-swift](https://github.com/shaynak/taylor-swift).

## Tasks

### 2024-08-26

- Right now the `if(val.lyric.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()))` seems too liberal: "hair" returns lyrics with "chair" and "hairy," "Christ" gives "Christian" and "Christina," "gun" returns "begun," et cetera.
- Filter by artist if not album between TBS, Grinderman, Cave/Ellis

## Changelog

### 2024-08-26
